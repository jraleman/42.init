*What file contains the local DNS entries?*

## Deduction

The file that contains the local DNS entries is in `/etc/hosts`.
We can try running the following command:

` > cat /etc/hosts`

This gives us the following output:

```
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost

#10.51.1.38 	cdn.intra.42.fr
```
