*Get the complete path of the file that contains the IP address of the
DNS server youâ€™re using*

## Deduction

The path to the file that contains the dns server is `/etc/resolv.conf`.
We can test this running the following command:

` > cat /etc/resolv.conf`

That gives us the following output:

```
#
# macOS Notice

# This file is not consulted for DNS hostname resolution, address
# resolution, or the DNS query routing mechanism used by most
# processes on this system.
#
# To view the DNS configuration used by this system, use:
#   scutil --dns
