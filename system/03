*What file has to be modified to make it permanent?*

## Deduction

We will need to modify the file `/etc/hostname` to make this permanent.
It can be done running the following command:

` > sudo echo "kwame-fanclub" > /etc/hostname`

And we can check this with the following command:

` > cat /etc/hostname`

This will give us the following output:

```
kwame-fanclub
```
